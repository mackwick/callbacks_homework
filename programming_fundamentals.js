//Read the linked article on programming principles, focus on the following nine:

// DRY - If you find that you're repeating the same long chunk of code multiple times, stop and use a loop, function, variable, etc.

// KISS - Avoid weird, complex code.

// Avoid creating a YAGNI - Don't add unneccessary stuff you don't need.

// Do the simplest thing that could possibly work - Look for the easiest option.

// Don't make me think - Write code that is easy for future, other editors to understand.

// Write code for the maintainer - Write code that is easy to fix and update.

// Single responsibility principle - Every piece should do one, well-definied thing.

// Avoid premature optimization - Focus on making your code work before making it work faster.

// Separation of concerns - Keep the things that do different things in different places.

// Write a ~1 sentence summary for each one 
    // (see above)

// Which ones surprise you (if any)?
    // None. They make sense.

// Which one is currently giving you the most struggle?
    // I'm probably not doing the simplest thing that could possible work because I don't know enough.
